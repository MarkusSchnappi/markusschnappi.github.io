### About me

In 2023, I joined msg research, a cross-cutting department of the [msg group](https://www.msg.group/) that focuses both on innovation projects and advanced education, as well as engaging in consulting and customer projects.



Between 2018 and 2023 I worked as a Research Associate and PhD student at the Chair of Software and Systems Engineering of Prof. Pretschner at the Technical University of Munich. My dissertation "On Machine Learning Assisted Software Maintainability Assessments" is concerned with expert analyses of large software systems and how machine learning techniques can help identify problematic source code. 

Prior to joining the chair, I studied [Software Engineering](https://elite-se.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/) in an elite graduate program hosted by the TU Munich in cooperation with the Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich and the University of Augsburg. These studies included stays at Capgemini and[ Lero - the Irish Software Research Institute](https://www.lero.ie/). I am also an alumnus of the [German Academic Scholarship Foundation](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/) (Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes), the [Elite Network of Bavaria](https://www.elitenetzwerk.bayern.de/en/home) (Elitenetzwerk Bayern) as well as the [Lothar and Sigrid Rohde-Foundation](https://www.rohde-stiftung.de/en/home.html).

### Research interests

My area of research is Software Quality. Software quality is viewpoint-specific and multi-dimensional. The aspects I am most interested in include

- Software maintainability and its assessment. This includes analyzing source code or designs for their comprehensibility, readability, adequate scoping and other attributes.
- Regression test selection: This discipline is concerned with selecting a subset of test cases from a large test suite to reduce the cost and time of testing while still finding all bugs.
- Requirements Engineering: Arguably, high-quality software satisfies its stakeholders' needs. However, eliciting, modeling, validating and managing requirements is not trivial, especially in agile development processes.

In summary, I am interested in doing things right in the first place and assessing the quality of created artifacts. In the longshot, my goal is to establish software quality analyses that are fast, cheap, reliable and require only little human expert interaction. Still, I strongly believe that final conclusions about the state of a system have to remain in the hands of experienced engineers due to the complexity of the system's context.





### Teaching

I have been involved with several teaching activities both during my time at Technical University of Munich and msg research: 

- Requirements Engineering: Exercise, Lecture preparation, Exams  (5 semester)
- Seminar on Software Quality: Organization, Thesis supervision (7 semesters)
- Introduction to Programming: Tutorials (1 semester)
- Thesis supervision (~20 theses)



Supervised theses include: 

- Vectorizing Software for Machine Learning *

- Investigating Inter-Class Attributes for Capturing Software Maintainability **

- Using Text Classification and Image-based Learning to Predict Software Quality ***

- Automatic Identification and Rating of the Usefulness of Source Code Comments

- Mining Repositories for Quality Indicators

- Detecting Smells in Data Models

- Quality Evaluation of Data Models

- Cornering Cohesion: Investigating new Ways to Measure Cohesion

- Measuring Cohesion and Coupling: a Comparison of Different Metrics and their Usefulness for Software Quality Analyses

- A Labeling Platform for Source Code

- Requirements documentation and analysis for changes to existing business systems

- Assessing the Quality of Code comments using machine learning

- Identification of generated Code

- Identifier Dictionaries

- Configuration of Static Analysis Tools for Effective Bug Detection

- Detecting Code Smells using Graph Neural Networks

- A Super-Metric for Measuring *Adequacy* in the Context of Software  Architecture and Software Programming
