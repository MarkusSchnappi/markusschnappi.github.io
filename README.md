# About me

MSG joined msg research, a cross-cutting department of msg group that focuses on customer projects, innovation projects, teaching, and consulting.



Betwen 2018 and 2023 I worked as a Research Associate and PhD student at the Chair of Software and Systems Engineering of Prof. Pretschner at the Technical University of Munich. 

Thesis title and summary. List of publications below. 



Prior to joining the chair, I studied [Software Engineering](https://elite-se.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/) in an elite graduate program hosted by the TU Munich in cooperation with the Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich and the University of Augsburg. These studies included internships at Capgemini and[ Lero - the Irish Software Research Institute](https://www.lero.ie/). I am also an alumnus of the [German Academic Scholarship Foundation](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/) (Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes), the [Elite Network of Bavaria](https://www.elitenetzwerk.bayern.de/en/home) (Elitenetzwerk Bayern) as well as the [Lothar and Sigrid Rohde-Foundation](https://www.rohde-stiftung.de/en/home.html).

## Research interest

**Software Quality** 

​	**internal** qualities, such as maintainability, and ways to assess it

​	(**functional**, mostly with a light focus on Regression Testing) and 

Requirements Engineering.

Quailty is viewpoint specific. ARguably, the view of the user is crucial. To fully understand and model the user's expectations and needs is vital to 



My area of research is Software Quality. I am interested in processes to assess the non-functional quality of (large) software systems and aim to automate these processes or parts thereof. In the longshot, my goal is to establish software quality analyses that are fast, cheap, reliable and do not require human expert interaction. Hence, my daily work features software measurement, machine learning, data mining, empirical studies, and investigating models for easier software comprehension.



# Teaching

During my time at Technical University of Munich, I dedicated some of my time to teaching and try to stick to this passion at industry, too. 



### Thesis Topics

If you are interested in doing your thesis or guided research in the field of internal Software Quality and its automatic assessment, feel free to contact me. As I work closely with industry, there are many  opportunities for practical and interesting projects. Some open topics are listed below. If one of them appeals to you in particular, I'm looking forward to your email with attached grade report and short cv.

Past theses  and seminar topics include: 

- Vectorizing Software for Machine Learning *

- Investigating Inter-Class Attributes for Capturing Software Maintainability **

- Using Text Classification and Image-based Learning to Predict Software Quality ***

## Lectures and Seminars

Between 2018 and 2023 I was responsible for organizing lectures, exercise, and exams for the course Requirements Engineering. 

From  as well as the Seminar involved with the organization of the Seminar on Software Quality ()



Since I left TUM I still actively participate in the Software Quality Seminar as an external supervisor.
